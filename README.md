# Introduction to the repo:

- This is a repo for mini-data analysis project milestone 1 for [STAT545 Part A](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/course/). 

- The dataset I chose is **cancer_sample** dataset (more information can be found on [UCI Machine learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic).

- This is repo contains R code to rudimentarily explore and visualize the cancer_sample dataset and propose 4 research questions for preparation of Milestone 2. It contains the reponses to all the questions in the Rmd file.


# How to engage with this repo:

  * **README.md** : This file provides high level summary of the repo
  * **milestone_1.Rmd** : This is the source code for all the data analysis and graph plotting. Download and run all the code chunks to reproduce analysis.
  * **milestone_1.md** : This is the output md file after rmd file is knitted using RStudio.
  * __*figures*__ : this directory contains all the plots related to **Task 2.1**, as I chose 4 questions to answer and some of them are associated with plots. Each plot is labeled with the question it is assiciated with.
